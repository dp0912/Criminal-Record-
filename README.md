# Criminal Record Management System

## Overview
The Criminal Record Management System is a C++ application designed to manage and maintain records of criminals. The system allows users to add, modify, delete, and display criminal records. Each record includes details such as personal information, descriptions, court details, and police information.

This project is currently implemented in C++, and future plans include integrating it with a MySQL database to enable persistent storage and advanced querying capabilities.

## Features
- **Add New Record:** Enter details of a new criminal record.
- **Modify Existing Record:** Update details of an existing record.
- **Delete Record:** Remove a criminal record from the system.
- **Display Record:** View the details of a specific criminal record.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C++ Compiler:** Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g., g++, clang++).
- **VSCode:** For development, you can use Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with C++ extensions.
- **Libraries:** No external libraries are required for the current implementation.
